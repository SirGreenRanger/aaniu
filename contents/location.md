The Anime Association now meets in McMurry Hall Room 308 located on the East side of campus near Altgeld Hall, Still Gym, and Wirtz Hall. Hopefully one day we will be back in our historic location, the Cole Hall preview room, only time will tell.

When entering McMurry Hall from the West, go to the top floor and to the farthest room on the left.

If entering from the South, use the elevator near the door or the stairs located on the West and East ends of the building.
