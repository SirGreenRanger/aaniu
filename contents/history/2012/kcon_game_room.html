<p>“Welcome to Mario Kart!” This Nintendo 64 classic will be featured as a tournament at this year’s Karoshi-Con. Face off against three other racers while using items such as Koopa shells, Super Stars, mushrooms, and other favorites from the series to speed by, blast, and dominate your competition. From cruising through Koopa Troopa Beach to dodging traffic on Toad’s Turnpike, and gliding down Rainbow Road, it’s a mad dash to the finish line; will you be the first to cross it?</p>
<h3 style="clear: both;">Super Smash Bros Brawl</h3>
<img src="img/kcon_game_ssbb.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
<p>Super Smash Bros. Brawl will once again make a return to Karoshi-Con’s video game Room. Are you an adorable, yet deceptively powerful Pikachu, or are you Hyrule’s hero, Link? Brawl it out with your favorite characters in various stages from across the Nintendo universe to make it to the top of the food chain!</p>
<h3 style="clear: both;">Guitar Hero 2</h3>

<p>New to the Karoshi-Con lineup of tournaments is Guitar Hero 2. Are you the ultimate rockstar? Come prove your worth by rockin’ it out against your competitors and entertaining the masses in guitar battles. Featuring favorites such as “Freebird,” “Beast and the Harlot,” and “Trogdor,” your skills will surely be put to the test.</p>
<h3 style="clear: both;">Tekken 6</h3>
<img src="img/kcon_game_t6.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 24px 24px;" />
<p>“The King of Iron Fist Tournament” is back with Tekken 6! Duke it out as your favorite characters from across the Tekken world. Control the art of Capoeira with Eddy and Christie, or use the Mishima Style Fighting Karate to obliterate your opponent with Heihachi. Whoever you choose, get ready for the next battle!</p>
