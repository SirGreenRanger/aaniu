<h1>The Anime Association of NIU</h1>
<hr/>
<p>We are Northern Illinois University's anime club located in McMurry Hall on campus in DeKalb, Illinois.</p>
<p>New members are welcome to all meetings! No registration required. Check out the <a href="index.php?c=location">location page</a> for directions.
<p>Our main activity is publicly showing different types of Japanese Animation (called anime), including movies, TV series, and direct-to-video releases. We show a variety of genres which include drama, comedy, romance, action, adventure, science fiction, and historical. These showings take place every Tuesday night and Thursday night from 6:00pm to 9:00pm during the Fall and Spring Semesters.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the Show Schedule page for a listing of what we are showing this semester. As of Fall 2012 we are meeting in McMurry Hall room 308. All of our showings are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Other club activities include art lessons, field trips, parties, and attending the Anime Central convention held in Rosemont, Illinois.</p>
