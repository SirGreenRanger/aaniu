<h1>Karoshi-Con: History</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Karoshi-Con 2010</h2>
<p>In 2010, Karoshi-Con made its debut on April 17th. It surpassed the AANIU's expectations, with over 175 attendees enjoying the various attractions the convention had to offer. Karoshi-Con 2010 featured a series of entertaining, hilarious, and informative panels, with 'Prove Me Wrong' leading the pack in fan favorites. The game room held three competitive tournaments; the 'Random Retro Tournament' drew the most competitors, with the winner receiving a GameStop gift card. The Viewing Rooms showed a large number of anime series, including the Steampunk-styled Last Exile and the comedic Cat Girl Nuku Nuku. Karoshi-Con's Vendor Room was a central hub throughout the convention, hosting big name vendors such as Eagle Anime and Fast Food Anime, as well as independent creators such as Pixelites and Cutie Plush. As a staff, we worked hard to provide an enjoyable and welcoming convention, and we believe we accomplished that.</p>

	<p>"Karoshi-Con's staff was friendly, informational and welcoming"</p>
	<p>"Really awesome for such a small, first-time con"</p>
	<p>"I really enjoyed it. I hope you do this for many years to come!"</p>
</span>
<p>As per the feedback we received, we plan to continue the convention for years to come.
In 2011, Karoshi-Con expanded its horizons, adding a tabletop, board game, and card game room to its repertoire of attractions. Card game tournaments were added alongside the video game tournaments. Karoshi-Con 2011 also marked the convention's first annual Cosplay Contest! The contest was a big hit with attendees, making it one of Karoshi-Con 2011's main events.</p>
<h2>Karoshi-Con 2013</h2>
<p>Karoshi-Con 2013 featured much of the same as the years previous: a Game Room with tournaments with the chance to win prizes, engaging panels encouraging audience participation, a Viewing Room with a variety of anime to preview and a place to relax, and a packed Vendor Room, offering all your favorite anime goods.</p>
