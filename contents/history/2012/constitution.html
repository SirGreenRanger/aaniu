	<h3 id="article_I">Article I: Definitions</h3>
	<p class="list_desc">There are two terms that come into use a great deal in the Anime Association NIU.</p>
	<li>The first is anime. Anime is the word used in the U.S. to mean Japanese animation specifically. Anime in Japan is made for all types of audiences including children, adolescents, and adults. In short, anime consists of the same types of genre seen on film and television.</li>
	<li>The second term is manga. Manga is, very simply, a Japanese comic. A great amount of anime is based upon a popular manga series or the other way around. Manga covers the same range of material as mentioned above for anime.</li>
</ol><ol>
	<h3 id="article_II">Article II: Purpose</h3>
	<p class="list_desc">The Purposes of the Anime Association shall be threefold:</p>
	<li>Firstly, to promote anime, manga, and the techniques associated with them;</li>
	<li>Secondly, to promote the understanding and enjoyment of other cultures and through that understanding to appreciate the diverse elements in our own culture;</li>
	<li>Thirdly, as a place for fans of anime to come together and meet other people.</li>
</ol><ol>
	<h3 id="article_III">Article III: Membership</h3>
	<li>No person shall be denied membership in the Anime Association due to race, ethnicity, age, sex, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, physical/mental capabilities, or university status. This means that there is no discrimination whatsoever.</li>
	<li>A person, after coming to two showings in a semester, must become a member by:</li>
	<ol class="list_sublist">
		<li>Paying the amount of money required for membership, if any is required;</li>
		<li>Signing his/her name to the membership roster;</li>
		<li>By signing up for membership, one agrees to the approved version of this constitution, or cease coming to the showings.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Membership may be revoked due to unruly and disruptive behavior at events among other things that adversely affect the Association. This particularly applies to any inappropriate talking during any showing. This is considered a major offense. Any offending member will be given at least one warning by an officer of the Association before being asked to leave.</li>
	<ol class="list_sublist">
		<li>Vote by a two-thirds majority of a quorum of the Association is required:</li>
		<ol class="list_sub_sublist">
			<li>To temporarily revoke membership from the club until the end of the semester, at which time another vote will be called to reinstate membership;</li>
			<li>To permanently revoke membership from the club.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>No person who has had membership revoked may attend an official Association event until that person's membership is reinstated.</li>
