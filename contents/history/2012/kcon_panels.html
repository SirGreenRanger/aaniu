Visual novels are your answer. Visual novels allow you, the reader, to take part in the story; influencing the plot through dialogue choices, decisions on actions to take, and in some cases, interactive puzzles. I will walk you through the interactive nature of visual novels and even teach you how to create your own!</p>
