<h3 align="center">Random Retro Tournament</h3>
<p>The main event in the Game Room will be the Random Retro Tournament. Each round will consist of a different game
 on a random system. Games will range from fighting, shooting, racing, puzzles, and more. Winner of this tournament
 will have the opportunity to participate in a special Championship Match should he/she decide to return next year. 
</p>

<h3 align="center">How the retro tournament works:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A game is chosen per round, not per match, using a custom random generation program. 
      Games are chosen on the spot to prevent advanced practice
  </li>
  <li>Games may come from, but are not limited to, PS3, XBox 360, Wii, Dreamcast, Gamecube,
      XBox, PS2, PS1, N64, Saturn, SegaCD, SNES, Genesis, or NES systems.
  </li>
  <li>Each match per round shall follow one specific vs. rule-set. Time limits of 5 minutes will be used where applicable
  </li>
  <li>Basic controls shall be explained each round, however specific tactics, like character move sets, will not be explained
  </li>
  <li>Should both players agree, where applicable, players may look at any in-game control/move lists ONCE per match
  </li>
  <li>Tournament officials reserve the right to run the program again before the round's first match should they feel that a 
      certain series/genre has been overdone. However, the officials do not have to re-run should they choose not to
  </li>
</ul>

  <h2 align="center">General Tournament Rules:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> All tournaments will be done in a typical bracketed fashion </li>
    <li> A &quot;match&quot; will consist of 2-4 players, depending on the game, with the winner(s) moving on </li>
    <li> A &quot;round&quot; is a series of matches where the players have the same win count, except where seeding is applied, and no one player plays more than once</li>
    <li> A prize will be awarded to the first place player</li>
    <li> Any outside distractions, such as physical contact or verbal abuse, will result in the expulsion of the offender </li>
    <li> Pausing must be announced in advance and agreed to by the other player</li>
    <li> Any ties will be resolved in a &quot;Sudden Death&quot; match </li>
    <li> No &quot;boss&quot; characters will be allowed where applicable. Other specific character bans will be done on a game-by-game basis. Game Tournament officials may choose to ban commonly banned characters, but reserve the right not to</li>
    <li> Names will be called as each match begins. Both players have 15 seconds to announce their presence and move their way up to the chairs before they are considered forfeit. If a player is indisposed, yet has someone to vouch for him/her, the current match will be moved to the end of the round. If either player is not present at the second attempt, he/she will forfeit</li>
    <li> Controller substitutions will be allowed and control schemes may be changed on a match-by-match basis</li>
    <li> Due to space limitations, the Game Room will be closed to casual gaming while tournaments are running</li>
