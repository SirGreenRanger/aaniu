<h2>Panels and their Descriptions:</h2>
 <p><strong>Baka Desnay! (Being An Idiot In Japan)</strong> - Want to know what it's like to learn Japanese, live in Japan, and then start a crazy-amazing indie animation project to teach Japanese? Then this panel is for you. Jimmy Trevor (known online as Sonicsuns) lived in Japan for 7 months, and started a blog called The Man In Japan. He is also starting up an animation project called "Baka Desnay!", which teaches Japanese in the most awesome way you can imagine. Jimmy will discuss his various experiences and plans, and will take questions from the audience. (Oh, and he's looking for volunteers for that animation project!)

<p><strong>Prove me Wrong</strong> - This is a discussion panel where the audience attempts to defend anime topics that we don't like. A group of friends with different tastes in anime pick out major topics, present a brief case on why they think is sucks, and let a few people from the audience give their rebuttal. Good rebuttals can be rewarded with a treat.</p>
