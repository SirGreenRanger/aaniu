### Mario Kart Wii

Also making an appearance as a Game Room tournament is Mario Kart Wii. Start your engines, rev up your bikes, and get ready to ride! The racetrack becomes a battlefield as banana peels are thrown down, and the Koopa shells go flying. In a race for first place, just about everything goes.

## General Tournament
and Game Room Rules

*   All tournaments will be done in a typical bracketed fashion
*   A "match" will consist of 2-4 players, depending on the game, with the winner(s) moving on
*   A "round" is a series of matches where the players have the same win count, except where seeding is applied, and no one player plays more than once
*   A prize will be awarded to the first place player
*   Unsportsmanlike behavior will not be tolerated. Unnecessary verbal and physical abuse will warrant ejection from the game room. This also applies to casual gaming
*   Pausing must be announced in advance and agreed upon by the other player
*   Ties will be resolved in a "Sudden Death" match
*   Tournament officials reserve the right to ban “boss” characters from use if they choose to
*   Please be present in the game room during your tournament’s designated time. Names will be called as each match begins. Players have 20 seconds to make their presence known else they will forfeit their chance at participating. If a player is not available, but someone can vouch for him/her, the current match will be moved to the end of the round. If either player is not present at the second attempt, he/she will forfeit
*   Control schemes may be changed on a match-by-match basis
